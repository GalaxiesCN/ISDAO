- Visible governance tools of DAO
- Market Pain Points
    - At present, the DAO market is in a period of high enthusiasm, and many DAO projects are born every day, but most of them have a homogeneous style of operation, a boring interface, and a lack of immersion. The members in the community lack more diverse and vivid ways to express their views and seek common recognition; at the same time, it is also difficult for other members to clearly understand the specific content of the projects in a community.
    - DAOs are currently in dire need of a tool to help their governance to manage the platform more efficiently.
- Target Users
    - The existing DAO, which emphasizes the process of community governance and the experience of community members, We will use our tools to empower DAO's community governance process.
- Solutions
    - Build platform: build visualizatied space and infrastructure for existing DAOs, design characters, and visualize some common DAO operational processes, and provide common basic DAO activity functions. Make the process of DAO governance more interesting and immersive for users.
    - Platform decoration: on the basis of the basic scene, provide users with more enriched decorations and more cool functional effects for a fee, sell some decorations to enable users to design their own community space; provide users with tools to create decorations and a platform for sales.
    - Main Process
        1. Customers will have their DAO access to the tool
        2. The system generates random role models for users to register
        3. Provide users with basic scenarios and visual communication tools
        4. Provide users with decorations available for purchase
        5. Provide a platform for users to create decorations and trade their own designed decorations
    - Product Operations
        - Designing characters and creating a communication environment
        - Provide services to DAO organizations that use ISDAO and charge a fee
        - Charge users a fee for transactions
- Future work
    - More decorations and more lively environments
    - Personalized personas
    - Provide users with tools for creation and platforms for trading
- Project Storyboard
    - As the DAO market grows, the downside of its lack of fun became apparent. In order to make DAO sustainable development, we hope to enhance users' sense of immersion and sense of reality, attract more new users and increase the sense of dependence of existing users, so as to prevent user loss.
    - Visualization helps new users to join by helping them quickly and accurately understand the complex behavior hidden in DAO. Visualize the governance process and results to enable new members to participate in DAO governance as quickly as possible.
- Development Process
    - The team members proposed the idea on December 18, 2021, and we started a series of discussions and analyses on its feasibility before finalizing the direction on December 25.
    - At the very beginning, one of the members noticed that the current use of DAO was rather homogeneous and that the feel of richness and immersion was important directions for its sustainable development. How to enhance the sense of realism and fun is our main consideration.
    - We initially wanted to do a 3D ISDAO because it would certainly be more immersive to the user. However, considering the high cost of implementation and the possibility of more problems in real use, we finally decided to do a 2D ISDAO.
    - At the same time, we want users to be involved in this process of enriching the DAO. So we hope to provide users with a platform for design, where they can design their own decorations, etc., for the construction of the DAO, or generating NFTs for trading.

- Technical Framework
    - Programming Language: JavaScript, Solidity
    - Technical Infrastructure: Aragon, React
    - Technical Inovation:
        
        Developed as a single DAO using the Buidler + React boilerplate based on the Aragon application, deployable on the Aragon on-chain network. Built using Aragon Core, it consists of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in Solidity language and a React web-side decentralized application (dApp). The use of Aragon solves the underlying infrastructural problems and allows the development to focus more on the innovative features of this project in order to visualize the DAO and concentrate more on the graphical presentation of the corresponding DAO operations and enhancing the user immersive experience.
